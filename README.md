This is the template repo for aoc projects. When using this template please use the naming conventions for inputs as dayXXinput.txt as the aocinput file that comes with this repo alows for ease of importing files. 

to number your days please use a constant as the day, it is an integer in Python. If you don't use python then do not use aocinput.py as your import shortcuts. 

How to use aocinput.py:

the function that is commonly used is called aocday. it contains 3 parameters: the day, importing it as list, or lines. setting the second parameter to true will cause the data to come out in a list, setting the third parameter to true and the second parameter to false will cause the data to come out in lines, if both are set to false nothing is placed, then it will come out in a single string.
